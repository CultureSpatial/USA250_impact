# **WINE FESTIVAL VERCHANDISING FRAMEWORK: RECONNAISSANCE ADAPTATION**

## **Mapping Festival Verchandising to VanWineFest Reconnaissance**



Based on your verchandising framework and the **VanWineFest reconnaissance constraint** (no producer content, no AR, mobile surfaces only), here's how to document these motions and integrate them into your existing roadmap.

---

## **1. SCOPE CLARIFICATION: VANWINEFEST VS. WINE TYCOON SPINE**

### **VanWineFest (March 7-14, 2026) = RECONNAISSANCE PHASE**

**IN SCOPE**:
- ✅ **Spatial pattern documentation** (booth locations, crowd flow observation)
- ✅ **Mobile-surface verchandising observation** (what do existing booths display on phones/tablets?)
- ✅ **Consent protocol validation** (Surface/Deep/Benthic tier testing)
- ✅ **Partner pipeline development** (identify 2-3 venues for future deployment)
- ✅ **Archetype taxonomy refinement** (observe "Veteran Sommelier," "Boutique Producer," etc.)
- ✅ **Digital Tribes conceptual testing** (gauge interest, NO technical implementation)

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- ❌ **Visual AR** (no AR overlays, no AR wayfinding)
- ❌ **Sales motion** (no DTC transactions, no checkout flow)
- ❌ **Technical deployment** (no app launch, no QR→Pre-Selection UI)
- ❌ **Digital collectibles** (NFT/loyalty systems deferred to later)

**RECONNAISSANCE GOAL**: Document **what SHOULD exist** for future deployment, not build it yet.

---

### **HOW-192: Wine Tycoon Spine (Q2-Q3 2026) = PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

**IN SCOPE**:
- ✅ **Actual wine lounge activation** (physical venue with Digital Campfire integration)
- ✅ **VTC (Virtual Tasting Component)** (video/audio tasting sessions with storytellers)
- ✅ **Full verchandising stack**:
  - Pre-Selection UI (queue optimization)
  - Infinite Shelf (DTC sales with AU metering)
  - Sponsor Paths (revenue-generating sponsor integrations)
  - Digital Tribes (leaderboards, gamification)
- ✅ **Mobile surfaces with AR** (AR Infinite Shelf, AR wayfinding in lounge)
- ✅ **Economic flow** (70/20/10 split, Stripe payouts, AU accounting)

**PRODUCTION GOAL**: Deploy **full verchandising framework** with revenue validation.

---

## **2. VANWINEFEST RECONNAISSANCE ACTIVITY SETS (UPDATED)**

### **Mapping Verchandising Framework to Reconnaissance Observations**

| Verchandising Motion | VanWineFest Reconnaissance Activity | Output | Feeds Into |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------|------------|
| **Pre-Selection UI (Queue)** | **Observe queue pain points** - How long do guests wait? - What questions do they ask? - Do they abandon? | Field notes: "Queue anxiety patterns" | HOW-192 Pre-Selection UI design |
| **AR Infinite Shelf (DTC)** | **Document existing DTC attempts** - Do booths have QR codes for online stores? - What's the conversion pitch? | Photo documentation: "Existing QR codes at 10 booths" | HOW-192 Infinite Shelf UX |

```
WINE LOUNGE (Physical Venue)
    ↓ emits engagement events
STA-39: CROSS-PLATFORM INGESTION
    ↓ normalizes as
ENGAGEMENT_EVENT (Pre-Selection, Infinite Shelf, Tribe actions)
    ↓ validates via
HOW-91: DIGITAL CAMPFIRE SPINE
    ↓ meters via
HOW-206: AU ACCOUNTING UNIT
    ↓ settles via
STRIPE CONNECT (70/20/10 split)
    ↓ visualizes in
STA-40: CRD VISIBLE FLAME (economic flow dashboard)
```

## **SUMMARY: VERCHANDISING FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION**

**What We've Done**:
1. ✅ Mapped 12 verchandising motions to VanWineFest reconnaissance
2. ✅ Clarified scope: VanWineFest = observation only, HOW-192 = production deployment
3. ✅ Created observation checklists for each motion (queue, DTC, wayfinding, tribes, etc.)
4. ✅ Integrated AU metering schema for all motions
5. ✅ Updated Gate 2 criteria to reflect verchandising reconnaissance

**What's Next**:
1. **This week (Feb 25-28)**: Create reconnaissance checklist + update Linear HOW-192
2. **VanWineFest (March 7-14)**: Execute reconnaissance observations (NO technical deployment)
3. **Post-reconnaissance (March 15-31)**: Write 30-page Verchandising Reconnaissance Report
4. **HOW-192 deployment (April-June)**: Build full verchandising stack at wine lounge pilot

**Net Result**: **VanWineFest reconnaissance feeds directly into HOW-192 production deployment**, ensuring verchandising framework is grounded in real-world festival observations rather than speculative design.
