# Business Case: Spatial Studio × Vancouver International Wine Festival

**Prepared for:** Vancouver International Wine Festival Leadership
**Prepared by:** CultureSpatial / Stadium Soundwave
**Date:** January 2026
**Re:** Strategic Partnership for VanWineFest 2026 and Beyond

---

## Executive Summary

The Vancouver International Wine Festival (VanWineFest) is Canada's premier wine event — 47 years strong, $10.3M raised for performing arts, consistently ranked #1 Food/Wine/Hospitality event in Canada. But like all experiential events, VanWineFest faces a strategic challenge:

> **The festival happens over 7 days. The value should last 365.**

Spatial Studio offers VanWineFest the infrastructure to **extend the festival experience before, during, and after** — transforming one-time attendees into year-round engaged participants, and giving sponsors measurable engagement they can't get from a logo on a banner.

**Partnership Investment:** $45,000–$120,000
**ROI Delivery:** Sponsor attribution, attendee journey data, year-round engagement platform

## The Opportunity: From Event to Ecosystem

### Current State (Event Model)

```
BEFORE              DURING                 AFTER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Marketing           7 days of events       Photos, memories
Ticket sales        Tastings, seminars     "See you next year"
                    Networking

VALUE CAPTURED: ~$3.5M ticket revenue
VALUE LOST: 51 weeks of dormant engagement
```

### Future State (Ecosystem Model)

```
BEFORE              DURING                 AFTER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-festival        Enhanced experiences   Year-round
spatial trails      with location-aware    engagement:
                    content
"Discover France    GPS-triggered          - Winery trails
before you taste"   tasting notes,         - Partner offers
                    winemaker stories      - Loyalty program
                                           - 2027 early access

VALUE CAPTURED: Year-round engagement + sponsor attribution
VALUE CREATED: Data asset, loyalty pipeline, sponsor proof
```

## Why This Matters for VanWineFest

### Challenge 1: Sponsor ROI is Hard to Prove

**Current:** Sponsors get logos, signage, mentions. Value is assumed, not measured.

**With Spatial Studio:**
- Track which experiences attendees engage with
- Attribute engagement to sponsor touchpoints
- Provide sponsors with actual interaction data
- Enable post-event offers tied to in-event behavior

**Example:** "National Bank Private Banking 1859 sponsored the Bacchanalia Gala. 847 attendees engaged with their spatial content, 312 saved a follow-up offer, 89 scheduled appointments."

### Challenge 2: Attendee Journey is Invisible

**Current:** You know who bought tickets. You don't know what they did.

**With Spatial Studio:**
- Map attendee journeys through the festival
- Identify popular pathways and drop-off points
- Understand which seminars/tastings drive engagement
- Optimize future programming based on actual behavior

**Example:** "French Regional Tasting stations had 3.2x longer dwell time than New World. Attendees who visited Bordeaux station first had 40% higher Grand Tasting completion."

### Challenge 3: The Festival "Dies" on March 15

**Current:** After closing night, engagement drops to near-zero until next year's ticket sales.

**With Spatial Studio:**
- Launch "BC Wine Trails" spatial experiences post-festival
- Connect attendees to participating wineries year-round
- Drive summer/fall visits to Okanagan, Vancouver Island
- Create 12-month engagement cycle, not 7-day spike

**Example:** "Attendees who engaged with 3+ wineries at VanWineFest receive personalized trail recommendations for BC wine regions — driving summer tourism with festival data."

## Alignment with BC Wine Tourism Ecosystem

### Cultivating Experiences Partnership

Destination BC and Wine Growers BC invested $15,000+ per winery in the "Cultivating Experiences" program to develop new wine tourism offerings. Spatial Studio provides the **distribution and engagement layer** for these experiences.

**Proposition to Destination BC:**
> "Festival attendees become wine tourists. Spatial Studio is the bridge."

### VineSight Corridor Integration

CultureSpatial's VineSight Corridor project (USA250 / FIFA 2026) is building "terroir-to-telemetry" infrastructure for wine tourism across the Pacific Northwest. VanWineFest becomes the **flagship urban activation** for this corridor.

```

## Appendix: Competitive Landscape

### What VanWineFest Could Do Instead

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Build in-house** | Full control | $200K+ dev cost, 12+ month timeline |
| **Festival app vendor** | Turnkey | Generic, no year-round value, no wine expertise |
| **Do nothing** | No cost | Sponsors increasingly demand attribution |
| **Spatial Studio** | Wine-specific, year-round, ecosystem integrated | Requires partnership investment |

### Why Not Just Use an Event App?

Event apps (Whova, Bizzabo, etc.) are built for conferences, not wine festivals. They don't understand:
- Terroir and regional storytelling
- Wine tourism journeys beyond the event
- Voice-driven tasting notes
- Winery-level attribution

Spatial Studio is **built for this category**.
