# Spatial Studio — Alternative GTM Glides

**Beyond Voice-Driven Cartography: Three Strategic Go-To-Market Approaches**

Each glide represents a distinct positioning, buyer persona, and sales motion. These are **not mutually exclusive** — they're variable entry points depending on partner context.

---

## Glide 1: Outcomes Infrastructure
### *"Prove What Your Programs Actually Do"*

**Core Insight:** Educational institutions and civic organizations are under pressure to demonstrate outcomes — but most lack infrastructure to measure place-based learning impact. Spatial Studio isn't just about *creating* experiences; it's about **proving they work**.

---

### Positioning Statement

> "Spatial Studio is outcomes infrastructure for place-based programs. We give you the measurement layer that turns anecdotal success into fundable evidence."

---

### Target Buyer Personas

| Persona | Title | Pain Point | Trigger Event |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Grant Writer** | Director of Development | "We need impact data for renewal applications" | Grant cycle approaching |
| **Program Evaluator** | VP of Programs | "We can't prove our field programs work" | Board pressure for metrics |
| **Government Administrator** | Agency Director | "Federal funding requires outcomes tracking" | New compliance mandate |
| **Foundation Officer** | Program Officer | "Our grantees can't show us what happened" | Portfolio review |

---

### Value Proposition Ladder

```
FEATURE          → BENEFIT           → OUTCOME              → IMPACT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Location-tagged  → Know where        → Optimize program     → Increase
engagement data    learning happens    routing & content     completion rates

Learning path    → See progression   → Identify drop-off    → Improve
analytics          through content     points                retention

Outcome          → Tie activities    → Generate evidence    → Secure
attribution        to results          for funders           continued funding

Cohort           → Compare groups    → Prove methodology    → Scale what
comparison         over time           effectiveness         works
```

---

### Key Messaging

**Headline:**
> From Field Trips to Fundable Evidence

**Subhead:**
> Your place-based programs generate learning. Spatial Studio proves it.

**Problem Statement:**
> You know your walking tours, field programs, and community experiences create impact. But when the grant renewal comes due, you're stuck with attendance counts and anecdotes. Funders want outcomes. Boards want metrics. You need infrastructure that captures what actually happens when learning meets place.

**Solution Statement:**
> Spatial Studio embeds measurement into the experience itself. Every location visited, every content piece engaged, every pathway completed — captured, analyzed, and reportable. Turn your field programs into evidence engines.

---

---

### Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Approach | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| SurveyMonkey / Qualtrics | Post-hoc surveys | We capture *in-situ* behavior, not recalled opinions |
| LMS platforms | Classroom-centric | We measure learning *in place*, not at desks |
| Custom app development | Expensive, siloed | We're infrastructure — one platform, all programs |
| Manual observation | Labor-intensive | We automate without losing qualitative richness |

---

### USA250/FIFA 2026 Application

> "The 250th anniversary will generate thousands of place-based programs. Which ones actually moved the needle on civic understanding? Spatial Studio gives federal and state funders the evidence layer to evaluate commemorative investments."

---

## Glide 2: Workforce Capacity Play
### *"Your Partners Can Build This — With Guild Academy"*

**Core Insight:** The bottleneck isn't software — it's **human capacity**. Most organizations want spatial experiences but lack staff who can create them. Guild Academy solves this by training cohorts from partner communities to become experience builders.

---

### Positioning Statement

> "Spatial Studio isn't a tool you buy — it's a capacity you build. Through Guild Academy, your organization develops internal expertise to create, deploy, and maintain spatial learning experiences indefinitely."

---

| Persona | Title | Pain Point | Trigger Event |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Workforce Dev Director** | VP of Talent / HR | "We need to upskill staff for digital programs" | Strategic plan mandate |
| **Community Foundation** | Program Officer | "Our grantees need technical capacity" | New initiative launch |
| **Tribal/Indigenous Leader** | Cultural Director | "We want to tell our stories, not outsource them" | Sovereignty initiative |
| **EDI Officer** | Chief Diversity Officer | "Our content creators don't reflect our communities" | DEI commitment |

```

---

### Key Messaging

**Headline:**
> Build Capacity, Not Dependency

**Subhead:**
> Guild Academy trains your team to create spatial experiences. You keep the expertise.

**Problem Statement:**
> You've seen impressive spatial experiences — immersive tours, location-based learning, interactive maps. But when you ask "who builds this?", the answer is always an expensive agency or a developer you don't have. You're stuck choosing between dependency or delay.

**Solution Statement:**
> Guild Academy changes the equation. We train cohorts from your organization — or your community — to become certified spatial experience builders. Using AI-assisted articulation tools, non-technical staff learn to create professional-grade experiences in 12 weeks. You don't rent capability; you own it.

### USA250/FIFA 2026 Application

> "USA250 needs 10,000+ spatial experiences across all 50 states. There aren't enough agencies to build them. Guild Academy creates a distributed workforce of community-based builders who create experiences that reflect local knowledge and lived expertise."

---

## Glide 3: Spatial Data Network
### *"Your Content Becomes Part of Something Bigger"*

**Core Insight:** Individual spatial experiences are valuable. But a **network of interconnected experiences** — searchable, linkable, remixable — is transformational. Spatial Studio isn't just a creation tool; it's a **contribution to a shared spatial knowledge graph**.

---

### Positioning Statement

> "Spatial Studio connects your content to a growing network of place-based knowledge. Your experiences don't stand alone — they link to related stories, enrich partner offerings, and gain visibility through the network effect."

---

### Target Buyer Personas

| Persona | Title | Pain Point | Trigger Event |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **DMO Executive** | CEO / CMO | "We have 50 attractions but no unified story" | Destination rebrand |
| **Consortium Director** | Network Lead | "Our members create content in silos" | Strategic alignment push |
| **Digital Director** | VP Digital / CDO | "Our content isn't discoverable" | SEO/discoverability audit |
| **Platform Builder** | CTO / Product Lead | "We need spatial content but can't create it all" | Platform expansion |

### Key Messaging

**Headline:**
> Join the Spatial Knowledge Network

**Subhead:**
> Your experiences connect to a growing ecosystem of place-based content.

**Problem Statement:**
> You've invested in creating great spatial content — a walking tour, an AR experience, a heritage trail. But it lives in isolation. Visitors don't find it. Related experiences don't link to it. You're a content island in a fragmented ocean.

**Solution Statement:**
> Spatial Studio connects you to the network. Your content becomes discoverable through the spatial knowledge graph — linked to related experiences, indexed for search, available via API for partner apps. When a visitor explores one node, they find yours. When a partner builds an app, your content is available. You're not alone; you're amplified.

| **Pricing Model** | SaaS tiers by program count | Cohort-based training investment | Network membership tiers |
| **Sales Cycle** | 3-6 months (grant aligned) | 6-12 months (budget planning) | 3-9 months (strategic initiative) |
| **Competitive Set** | Survey tools, LMS, evaluators | Agencies, bootcamps, consultants | SEO, marketing, app platforms |
| **USA250 Hook** | "Which programs actually worked?" | "Who builds 10,000 experiences?" | "How do visitors navigate it all?" |

---

## Recommended GTM Sequence

### Phase 1: Lead with Outcomes (Q1-Q2 2026)
- Clearest pain point (grant cycle urgency)
- Fastest sales cycle
- Creates case studies for other glides

### Phase 2: Layer in Workforce (Q2-Q4 2026)
- Longer sales cycle but higher LTV
- Differentiated from SaaS competitors
- Creates network of certified builders

### Phase 3: Activate Network (Q4 2026+)
- Requires critical mass of content
- Highest long-term value
- Creates defensible moat

---

## Cross-Glide Synergies

```
OUTCOMES INFRASTRUCTURE
        │
        │ "We proved impact, now we need to scale"
        ↓
WORKFORCE CAPACITY
        │
        │ "Our builders created content, now we need reach"
        ↓
SPATIAL DATA NETWORK
        │
        │ "Network discovery increases engagement"
        ↓
OUTCOMES INFRASTRUCTURE (loop)
```

All three reinforce each other. Entry point varies by partner context.
