# B2B Vocational Training Model

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Foundation:** SCID/DACUM + UMCES-CGC Technical Capacity Model

---

## Executive Summary

**Human capacity building is both the product and the infrastructure.**

We offer B2B workforce development that:
- Trains employees with **lived expertise** to contribute to production code in 6-12 weeks
- Uses **AI-assisted articulation literacy** to bridge technical skill gaps
- Validates infrastructure through **co-design with hardest governance cases**
- Provides **portable credentials** (Verifiable Credentials via AT Protocol)
- Generates **recurring revenue** while simultaneously serving as **R&D cost center**

## Market Position: Not HR/DEI, Not Bootcamp

### What We Are NOT

| Traditional Model | Why We're Different |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **HR/DEI Training Department** | We don't teach cultural sensitivity workshops. We recruit technical co-designers. |
| **Coding Bootcamp** | We don't teach syntax to build demo apps. We assist domain experts to build production infrastructure. |
| **Consulting Firm** | We don't parachute in, deliver a report, and leave. We embed guild members who own the code. |
| **SaaS Platform** | We don't sell software licenses. We sell capacity-building that produces portable IP. |

### What We ARE

**Technical Infrastructure R&D Department**

- **Engineering mandate**, not cultural initiative
- **Co-design from inception**, not retrofitting for inclusion
- **Lived expertise as technical qualification**, not diversity metric
- **Pattern Module creation**, not software consumption

---

## Revenue Model: Dual Nature

### Revenue Center Components

## Value Proposition: Why Businesses Buy

### Problem 1: Traditional Hiring is Slow

**Traditional Path:**
- Post job → Filter resumes → Interview → Hire → Onboard → Wait 6-12 months for contribution
- **Cost:** $50,000-100,000+ in recruiting + salary before first meaningful output

**Guild Academy Path:**
- Identify domain need → Recruit lived expertise → AI-assisted contribution in 6-12 weeks
- **Cost:** $5,000-10,000/member training + compensation = faster ROI

### Problem 2: Inclusive Design is Hard (and Expensive to Fix Later)

**Traditional Path:**
- Build product → Launch → Discover accessibility/sovereignty issues → Expensive retrofit
- **Example:** AR navigation system fails wheelchair users → $200,000+ redesign

**Guild Academy Path:**
- Co-design with wheelchair users from inception → Test at build time → Launch validated
- **Savings:** 70-80% reduction in post-launch fixes

### Problem 3: Knowledge is Platform-Captured

**Traditional Path:**
- Train employee on proprietary tools → Employee leaves → Knowledge walks out the door
- **Cost:** Perpetual retraining cycles

**Guild Academy Path:**
- Issue Verifiable Credentials → Portable skills across employers → Pattern Modules stay with company
- **Benefit:** Knowledge transfer + credential portability attracts talent

### Problem 4: Compliance Theater vs. Real Validation

**Traditional Path:**
- Check diversity boxes → Pass audits → Infrastructure still fails marginalized users
- **Example:** "Accessible" venue still has barriers wheelchair users can't navigate

**Guild Academy Path:**
- Infrastructure validated by lived expertise → Audits backed by co-designer signatures
- **Benefit:** Regulatory confidence + brand differentiation

## Sales Process

### Lead Generation
1. **Conference presentations** - Thought leadership, demo modular components
2. **Pop-up events at hospitality venues** - Real-world validation with customers present
3. **Dev post submissions** - Developer community engagement drives technical credibility
4. **Domain workshops** - Co-design sessions reveal pain points, build trust

### Qualification Criteria

**Green Light Indicators:**
- Organization has **technical capacity gap** (can't hire fast enough, missing domain expertise)
- Faces **hardest governance cases** (tribal sovereignty, disability access, economic equity)
- Willing to **compensate co-designers** (not looking for free labor)
- Seeks **validated infrastructure** (not interested in "good enough")

**Red Light Indicators:**
- Wants "diversity training" (HR/DEI mandate, not engineering need)
- Expects "cheap labor" (sees guild members as interns, not co-designers)
- Refuses **AI transparency** (wants black-box automation)
- Resists **pattern portability** (demands platform lock-in)

### Sales Cycle

1. **Discovery Workshop (Week 1-2):** Free 2-hour session exploring domain challenges
2. **Pilot Proposal (Week 3-4):** Custom cohort design, pricing, deliverables
3. **Contract Negotiation (Week 5-6):** Legal review, co-designer agreements
4. **Cohort Launch (Week 7+):** 12-24 week engagement

**Close Rate (projected):** 30-40% of qualified leads
**Average Deal Size:** $75,000-150,000

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Coding Bootcamps (General Assembly, Lambda School)
**They:** Teach syntax to career switchers → graduates seek jobs
**We:** Teach domain experts to articulate technical needs → AI assists → graduates contribute to existing infrastructure

### vs. Consulting Firms (McKinsey, Deloitte)
**They:** Analyze, recommend, deliver report → client implements
**We:** Embed guild members → co-design → client owns pattern modules

### vs. DEI Training (Paradigm, Verna Myers)
**They:** Cultural competency workshops → hope for behavior change
**We:** Recruit lived expertise → validate infrastructure → measure technical performance

### vs. SaaS Platforms (Workday, Salesforce)
**They:** License software → lock-in
**We:** Build capacity → portable credentials + pattern modules

## SCID/DACUM Integration

### SCID (Systematic Curriculum and Instructional Development)
- **Define competencies** for each guild role (Sensor Deployment, Spatial Viz, etc.)
- **Map to projects** (Fort Vancouver, Royal Sonesta)
- **Measure outcomes** (commits merged, VCs issued, Pattern Modules published)

### DACUM (Developing A Curriculum)
- **Industry panels** (hospitality, tribal nations, disability advocates) define needed skills
- **Task analysis** breaks down into teachable units (sensor placement, API integration, AR design)
- **AI-assisted delivery** bridges gaps (copilot generates code, member validates against domain requirements)

### UMCES-CGC Validation
- Model proven at Chesapeake Bay scale (Data Intern Projects, AI/ML workshops)
- Technical rigor + community co-design coexist
- Guild Academy replicates for viticulture/hospitality/tourism

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Co-Designers Feel Exploited
**Mitigation:**
- Constitutional economic floor (30% of training revenue)
- Pattern Module ownership (portable IP via VCs)
- Human approval gates (AI cannot auto-commit)

### Risk 2: Partners Want Cheap Labor, Not Co-Design
**Mitigation:**
- Qualify leads rigorously (see Sales Process)
- Public charter (Guild Academy Charter TSX visible to partners)
- Refuse contracts that violate constitutional bounds

### Risk 3: Scaling Dilutes Quality
**Mitigation:**
- Guild master mentorship model (Phase 4 PBL)
- Pattern Library as quality control (only validated modules published)
- Regional partnerships (UMCES-CGC model: scale via university networks)

### Risk 4: AI Replaces Human Expertise
**Mitigation:**
- Constitutional bounds enforce human sovereignty
- Lived expertise primacy rule (when AI conflicts with member, member wins)
- Articulation literacy (AI assists, does not replace)
